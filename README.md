# Design Patterns Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the Design Patterns Overview! This document serves as a guide to understand and apply design patterns in object-oriented programming. Design patterns are essential tools for improving software design, promoting flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational

Creational design patterns focus on how objects are created from classes. Proper object instantiation is crucial for a robust software design. The following creational design patterns are covered:

- **Builder Pattern**
- **Prototype Pattern**
- **Singleton Pattern**
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**

### Structural

Structural design patterns address class composition, emphasizing how classes are constructed and organized. These patterns contribute to a clear and efficient class hierarchy. The structural design patterns include:

- **Adapter Pattern**
- **Bridge Pattern**
- **Composite Pattern**
- **Decorator Pattern**
- **Facade Pattern**
- **Flyweight Pattern**
- **Proxy Pattern**

### Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns dictate the interaction between classes and objects, as well as the delegation of responsibilities. They enhance communication patterns between objects, promoting flexibility and maintainability. The behavioral design patterns consist of:

- **Interpreter Pattern**
- **Template Pattern**
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
- **Command Pattern**
- **Iterator Pattern**
- **Mediator Pattern**
- **Memento Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**
- **State Pattern**
- **Strategy Pattern**
- **Visitor Pattern**
